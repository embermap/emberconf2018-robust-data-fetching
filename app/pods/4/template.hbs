    Our product manager has noticed something odd. They come to
    us and say that they've had the browser open for a few hours
    and that none of the stocks are displaying any new prices.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Our co-worker thinks this is odd, because when they open the
    the `pods/4/stock-detail/route.js` file, they can see that
    the model hook is calling `findRecord`. Shouldn't the data
    refresh everytime the user clicks a link to a stock's details?
  </p>

  <p>
    What's going on? Can you fix this for us?
